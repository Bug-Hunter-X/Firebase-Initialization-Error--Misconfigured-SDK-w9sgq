This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in Firebase initialization: improper configuration. The `firebaseBug.js` file shows incorrect initialization, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides the correct setup.  Ensure your Firebase config object matches the structure and includes all necessary API keys and URLs.  Always double-check your Firebase project settings to confirm accurate configuration details.  Ignoring this can lead to silent failures and difficult-to-debug issues.
